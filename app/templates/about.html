        I wanted to become an ordinary human. But due to unfortunate circumstances I was forced to live my life as a rogue. I trained and developed my ninshu, which led me to greater understanding of the world around me. <br>
        I publish the learnings of the hard training at <a href="computableverse.com">computableverse.com</a>. I also publish rough notes over at <a href="/o">oxal.org/o/</a>

    <p>I've learnt to use a lot of tools on my path to the ultimate mastery. Some I've borrowed, some I've created. All of those tools are listed here: <a href="tools">oxal.org/tools</a></p>

        We will gradually become indifferent to what goes on in the minds of other people when we acquire an adequate knowledge of the superficial nature of their thoughts, of the narrowness of their views, and of the number of their errors. Whoever attaches a lot of value to the opinion of the others, pays them, too much honor. - Arthur Schopenhauer
